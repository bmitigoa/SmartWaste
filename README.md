## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

### 2. Open the project in Android Studio
- Go to **File → Open**
- Select the project folder
- Allow Gradle to sync automatically

### 3. Add your Firebase configuration
Download your Firebase `google-services.json` and place it in:
*(This file is intentionally excluded from GitHub for security.)*

### 4. Run the app
Use a real device or Android emulator:

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Firebase stores the waste bins’ fill levels and status.
2. The app fetches this information in real time.
3. Users can report when a bin is full.
4. Reports are sent instantly to Firebase for action by waste management teams.

---

## 🛡️ Security Notes
- `google-services.json` is not included for safety.
- No admin passwords or sensitive keys are stored in the repository.
- Firebase API keys are restricted to Android applications only.
